# teachingMoments
A collection of cyber security teaching materials.

I decided to get off the bench and start talking at my local Defcon (Glasgow DC44141) regularly with tutorials. 
I appreciate that people want to have the content after the fact so that is exactly what this is covering.

# SQL Injection

This was delivered in two chunks. The first will teach you the basics of SQL, and SQL injection and has demonstrations
you can follow along with too.

## Intro to SQL Injection
Intro level is in [SQL_Injection/intro](SQL_Injection/intro) folder.
The slides as used in Defcon Glasgow (DC44141) for February 2020 are in the PDF in that folder.
The Readme.md file explains how to start the target used during the demonstration so you can play along.
I recorded a video of content similar to what was said on the night on youtube here:

The Intro(ish) level is in the [SQL_Injection/round2](SQL_Injection/round2) folder.
The slides as used in Defcon Glasgow (DC44141) for March 2020 are in the PDF in that folder.
The Readme.md file explains how to start the target used during the demonstration so you can play along.
